I think that because we\\'ve been running a test in LightGBM with similar code, to confirm that `lightgbm` isn\\'t creating unnecessary copies in its `pandas` support since January 2022 (https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/pull/4927), and that test is now failing with `pandas>=3.0.0`.\\r\\n\\r\\nApologies in advance if this is intentional behavior.

These false negatives occur for functions that are indirectly accessed through the Series accessors. Instead of the actual functions, they call `f(self, *args, **kwargs)` in pandas/core/accessor.py. When validating the docstrings, f's signature is used instead of the actual function's signature. PR01 is raised since the docstring does not have *args and **kwargs in the signature, and PR02 is raised since the parameters in the docstrings are not in the signature. I found this happens for Series.cat and Series.dt.\\r\\n\\r\\nI added a check before validating the docstring to replace accessor names with the actual function's name. I'm sure there's a better way to implement this, but I'm not too knowledgeable on how these accessors work exactly. I couldn't figure out a way to get the delegated function from an accessor so I ended up with this crude solution using string literals.\\r\\n\\r\\nAny suggestions or advice would be really helpful!\",\n",

However, framelikes are more like python lists, which don\\'t have a hash-map-esque behavior.\\r\\n\\r\\nAm I missing something here that would cause poorly defined behavior?\\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nthe existing fast hash-based implementation should work for hashable types, but we should have a O(n) fallback implementation for unhashable types.\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\r\\n\\r\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\r\\n------------------\\r\\ncommit           : e8093ba372f9adfe79439d90fe74b0b5b6dea9d6\\r\\npython           : 3.8.10.final.0\\r\\npython-bits      : 64\\r\\nOS               : Linux\\r\\nOS-release       : 5.15.0-1064-azure\\r\\nVersion          : #73~20.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Mon May 6 09:43:44 UTC 2024\\r\\nmachine          : x86_64\\r\\nprocessor        : x86_64\\r\\nbyteorder        : little\\r\\nLC_ALL           : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\nLANG             : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\nLOCALE           : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\n\\r\\npandas           : 1.4.3\\r\\nnumpy            : 1.23.1\\r\\npytz             : 2022.1\\r\\ndateutil         : 2.8.2\\r\\nsetuptools       : 45.2.0\\r\\npip              : 20.0.2\\r\\nCython           : None\\r\\npytest           : None\\r\\nhypothesis       : None\\r\\nsphinx           : None\\r\\nblosc            : None\\r\\nfeather          : None\\r\\nxlsxwriter       : None\\r\\nlxml.etree       : None\\r\\nhtml5lib         : None\\r\\npymysql          : None\\r\\npsycopg2         : None\\r\\njinja2           : None\\r\\nIPython          : None\\r\\npandas_datareader: None\\r\\nbs4              : None\\r\\nbottleneck       : None\\r\\nbrotli           : None\\r\\nfastparquet      : None\\r\\nfsspec           : None\\r\\ngcsfs            : None\\r\\nmarkupsafe       : None\\r\\nmatplotlib       : 3.5.2\\r\\nnumba            : None\\r\\nnumexpr          : None\\r\\nodfpy            : None\\r\\nopenpyxl         : 3.1.2\\r\\npandas_gbq       : None\\r\\npyarrow          : None\\r\\npyreadstat       : None\\r\\npyxlsb           : None\\r\\ns3fs             : None\\r\\nscipy            : 1.9.0\\r\\nsnappy           : None\\r\\nsqlalchemy       : None\\r\\ntables           : None\\r\\ntabulate         : None\\r\\nxarray           : None\\r\\nxlrd             : None\\r\\nxlwt             : None\\r\\nzstandard        : None\\r\\n\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n',\n",

This bug report is for reference.\\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nAny combination of arguments should be supported or otherwise the function must fail telling the user what is the unsupported combination.\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\r\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\r\\n------------------\\r\\ncommit                : 272e69ceaf66a72eebf7a7ed7dbcd3342b8c99ae\\r\\npython                : 3.12.3.final.0\\r\\npython-bits           : 64\\r\\nOS                    : Linux\\r\\nOS-release            : 6.8.0-31-generic\\r\\nVersion               : #31-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Sat Apr 20 00:40:06 UTC 2024\\r\\nmachine               : x86_64\\r\\nprocessor             : x86_64\\r\\nbyteorder             : little\\r\\nLC_ALL                : None\\r\\nLANG                  : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\nLOCALE                : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\n\\r\\npandas                : 3.0.0.dev0+1053.g272e69ceaf\\r\\nnumpy                 : 1.26.4\\r\\npytz                  : 2024.1\\r\\ndateutil              : 2.9.0.post0\\r\\nsetuptools            : 69.5.1\\r\\npip                   : 24.0\\r\\nCython                : 3.0.10\\r\\npytest                : 8.2.0\\r\\nhypothesis            : 6.102.4\\r\\nsphinx                : 7.3.7\\r\\nblosc                 : None\\r\\nfeather               : None\\r\\nxlsxwriter            : 3.2.0\\r\\nlxml.etree            : 5.2.2\\r\\nhtml5lib              : 1.1\\r\\npymysql               : 1.4.6\\r\\npsycopg2              : 2.9.9\\r\\njinja2                : 3.1.4\\r\\nIPython               : 8.23.0\\r\\npandas_datareader     : None\\r\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\r\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\r\\nbs4                   : 4.12.3\\r\\nbottleneck            : 1.3.8\\r\\nfastparquet           : 2024.2.0\\r\\nfsspec                : 2024.5.0\\r\\ngcsfs                 : 2024.5.0\\r\\nmatplotlib            : 3.9.0\\r\\nnumba                 : 0.59.1\\r\\nnumexpr               : 2.10.0\\r\\nodfpy                 : None\\r\\nopenpyxl              : 3.1.2\\r\\npyarrow               : 16.1.0\\r\\npyreadstat            : 1.2.7\\r\\npython-calamine       : None\\r\\npyxlsb                : 1.0.10\\r\\ns3fs                  : 2024.5.0\\r\\nscipy                 : 1.13.0\\r\\nsqlalchemy            : 2.0.29\\r\\ntables                : 3.9.2\\r\\ntabulate              : 0.9.0\\r\\nxarray                : 2024.5.0\\r\\nxlrd                  : 2.0.1\\r\\nzstandard             : 0.22.0\\r\\ntzdata                : 2024.1\\r\\nqtpy                  : 2.4.1\\r\\npyqt5                 : None\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n\",\n",

However, when using Pandas\\' numba-compiled agg function, ints are coerced into floats.\\r\\n\\r\\nBest I can tell the issue is here https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/b162331554d7c7f6fd46ddde1ff3908f2dc8bcce/pandas/core/groupby/numba_.py#L114, which seems to always initialize the array to float. When I add a `dtype=values.dtype` to that constructor, it works as expected.\\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nIdeally the numba engine behavior would match Pandas\\' and use the dtype of the aggregate function\\'s result, but I\\'m not sure that\\'s possible. A more practical solution would be to accept an optional `result_dtype` argument that defaults to np.float (making that default more explicit) and pass that to the result array constructor. It would also be helpful for this nuance to be documented.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\r\\n\\r\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\r\\n------------------\\r\\ncommit           : 2e218d10984e9919f0296931d92ea851c6a6faf5\\r\\npython           : 3.11.9.final.0\\r\\npython-bits      : 64\\r\\nOS               : Darwin\\r\\nOS-release       : 23.4.0\\r\\nVersion          : Darwin Kernel Version 23.4.0: Fri Mar 15 00:10:42 PDT 2024; root:xnu-10063.101.17~1/RELEASE_ARM64_T6000\\r\\nmachine          : arm64\\r\\nprocessor        : arm\\r\\nbyteorder        : little\\r\\nLC_ALL           : None\\r\\nLANG             : None\\r\\nLOCALE           : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\npandas           : 1.5.3\\r\\nnumpy            : 1.26.4\\r\\npytz             : 2024.1\\r\\ndateutil         : 2.8.2\\r\\nsetuptools       : 65.5.0\\r\\npip              : 24.0\\r\\nCython           : 3.0.10\\r\\npytest           : 7.2.2\\r\\nhypothesis       : None\\r\\nsphinx           : None\\r\\nblosc            : None\\r\\nfeather          : None\\r\\nxlsxwriter       : None\\r\\nlxml.etree       : 5.2.1\\r\\nhtml5lib         : None\\r\\npymysql          : None\\r\\npsycopg2         : 2.9.3\\r\\njinja2           : 3.1.3\\r\\nIPython          : None\\r\\npandas_datareader: None\\r\\nbs4              : 4.12.3\\r\\nbottleneck       : None\\r\\nbrotli           : None\\r\\nfastparquet      : None\\r\\nfsspec           : 2024.3.1\\r\\ngcsfs            : None\\r\\nmatplotlib       : 3.8.4\\r\\nnumba            : 0.59.1\\r\\nnumexpr          : None\\r\\nodfpy            : None\\r\\nopenpyxl         : None\\r\\npandas_gbq       : None\\r\\npyarrow          : 16.0.0\\r\\npyreadstat       : None\\r\\npyxlsb           : None\\r\\ns3fs             : None\\r\\nscipy            : 1.13.0\\r\\nsnappy           : None\\r\\nsqlalchemy       : 2.0.30\\r\\ntables           : None\\r\\ntabulate         : 0.9.0\\r\\nxarray           : None\\r\\nxlrd             : None\\r\\nxlwt             : None\\r\\nzstandard        : None\\r\\ntzdata           : 2024.1\\r\\n\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n',\n",

However, the order of the bars in the chart is flipped - the last entry in the legend is on top. This doesn't make sense and makes the charts confusing to read.\\r\\n![image](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/assets/10804060/2de953f8-e7d8-451b-8da9-f86b62e80884)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n### Feature Description\\r\\n\\r\\nThe order of bars in the chart should be the same as the legend - top to bottom and left to right from the columns.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Alternative Solutions\\r\\n\\r\\nCould use matplotlib as a hack workaround. The easy solution is `plt.gca().invert_yaxis()` and seems like this should be in the pandas codebase for bar plots. https://stackoverflow.com/a/34094001/4549682\\r\\n\\r\\n### Additional Context\\r\\n\\r\\n_No response_\",\n",

However the [groups attribute](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/groupby.html#groupby-object-attributes) still returns scalars instead of 1-tuples which I consider to be a bug or at least requiring enhancement.  \\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nI expect group names / keys to be 1-tuples when grouping with a length-1 list: group by scalar get scalar names, group by list get tuple names. (I would also propose that grouping by an empty list should return a single group of the whole dataframe, with an empty tuple as the key, but thats out of scope for this issue!)\\r\\n\\r\\nI expect the same group name / key behaviour whether  [iterating through groups](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/groupby.html#iterating-through-groups) or accessing groups via the [groups attribute](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/groupby.html#groupby-object-attributes). \\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\r\\n<summary>latest release
